# nerdle-solver
a semi-automatic solver for [Nerdle](https://nerdlegame.com).<br><br>

## Requirements
Python 3, SymPy
<br><br>

## Quick Start
first, please traverse through all the letters manually
```
# recommended equations for 8 columns Nerdle
0 + 1 2 / 3 = 4
9 * 8 - 7 = 6 5
```
<br>

then, execute `nerdle-solver.py`
```
python nerdle-solver.py
```

<br>
one more step: answer a few questions to help initialize the solver!

1. valid letters <br>
  the numbers that are in the solution, either you guessed in the correct or wrong spot
2. position of the equal sign <br>
  by answering if the equal sign is at the second or third last spot

<br>
and done!
<br><br>

## Get Involved
the solver currently does not support 6 columns mini Nerdle.
